# 1.0.1

- The module will now attempt to support Polyglot on all systems. This only works when the actor structure is similar. For example, PF2e and DnD5e both use `actor.system.traits.languages.value` to store language strings on an actor, so the module will work for both systems.
- Support for additional flavor text, such as the flavor text when rolling weapon attacks in DnD5e.

# 1.0.0

Finally! This module has been in the works for a month now, and I can now confidently release this to the public.

If you didn't read the description, this module is made as a successor to [DiscordConnect](https://github.com/caoranach/DiscordConnect/). It mirrors public chat messages on FVTT to a Discord channel. This will work *very well* on PF2e, and decently on other systems.

**Features:**
- Tokens to Discord Avatars
- Automatic chat card formatting
- Roll embeds
- and more!
